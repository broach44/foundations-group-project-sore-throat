        <p>

           Sore Throat started making music in 1999 but it was long after that before they were known.  Starting in the typical setup of one of the member's garage they got together after school before their parents got home and jammed all afternoon.  The first hit single "I need some water!" was released in January 2001.  Later that year they swung another home run with "Screaming at my parents" in October.  The following year their debut tour with Huggie Bears.  The rest is history....
